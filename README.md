# AI/ML Learning Repository

## Python Foundations

Read, explore, manipulate, and visualize data to tell stories, solve business
problems, and deliver actionable insights and business recommendations using
some of the most widely used Python packages.
• Python Programming Fundamentals (Variables and Datatypes, Data
Structures, Conditional and Looping Statements, Functions)
• Python for Data Science - NumPy and Pandas
• Python for Visualization
• Exploratory Data Analysis (Univariate Analysis, Bivariate/Multivariate
Analysis, Missing Value Treatment, Outlier Detection and Treatment)
• AI Application Case Studies

## Machine Learning

Understand the concept of learning from data, build linear and non-linear
models to capture the relationships between attributes and a known outcome,
and discover patterns and segment data with no labels.
Graded Project | Personal Loan Campaign Purchase Prediction
Build a Machine Learning model to identify potential customers for a bank
who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan and the driving
factors behind the decision making.
• Intro to Supervised Learning - Linear Regression
• Decision Trees (Regression Trees, Logistic Regression)
• K-Means Clustering (Hierarchical Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, PCA)

## Advanced Machine Learning

Combine the decisions from multiple models using ensemble techniques to
improve model performance and make better predictions, and employ feature
engineering techniques and hyperparameter tuning to arrive at generalized,
robust models to optimize associated business costs.
• Bagging and Random Forest
• Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Stacking)
• Model Tuning
